- 👋 Hi, I’m @AC-ecology, a PhD candidate based at The Centre for Research into Envrionmental and Ecological Modelling (CREEM St Andrews)
- 👀 I’m interested in developing and applying statistical methods to study animal populations, distributions, interactions and their determinants
- 🌱 I’m currently working to integrate outputs from neural networks applied to remote-sensed images and acoustic recordings to study the impacts of human recreation on species distributions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on advancing multi-species occupancy models, modelling machine learning output as well as projects focused human-wildlife interactions
- 📫 Reach me via email at ajpc1@st-andrews.ac.uk or on Twitter @AmberCowans
